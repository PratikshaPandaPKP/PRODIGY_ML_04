1. **Data Preparation**: Images of hand gestures representing various classes are loaded and preprocessed.

2. **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed using layers such as Conv2D, Activation, MaxPool2D, Dropout, and Dense to extract features and classify hand gestures.

3. **Training**: The model is trained on the prepared data, achieving high accuracy (99.97%) on the test set after 7 epochs.

4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like loss, accuracy, and a confusion matrix, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing different hand gestures.

Overall, this hand gesture recognition model provides a robust solution for accurately identifying and classifying hand gestures, facilitating seamless human-computer interaction and control systems.
